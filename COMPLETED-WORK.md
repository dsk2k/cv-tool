## Key Features Explained

### 1. Live Translation 🌐
**What:** One-click Dutch ↔ English translation on improvements page
**Where:** Top-right button on improvements.html
**How it works:**
- First click: Calls Gemini API (~3-5s)
- Subsequent clicks: Instant (cached in browser)
- Preserves all markdown formatting

**Cost:** ~$0.01 per translation (cached = free)

---

### 2. Smart Caching 💰
**What:** Saves AI API calls by caching results
**How it works:**
- Generates SHA-256 hash of CV + job description
- Checks cache before calling AI
- Saves $0.008 per cache hit

**Savings:** 60% cache hit rate = $10-15/mo saved

---

### 3. Rate Limiting 🛡️
**What:** Prevents abuse by limiting requests
**Default:** 10 requests per hour per IP
**Customizable:** Edit rate-limiter.js

**Benefit:** Prevents cost spikes from bots/abuse

---

### 4. Health Monitoring 🏥
**What:** System health check endpoint
**URL:** `/.netlify/functions/health`
**Checks:**
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Database connection
- ✅ AI API key
- ✅ Memory usage

**Use:** Uptime monitoring, debugging

---

### 5. Cache Statistics 📊
**What:** Real-time cache performance metrics
**URL:** `/.netlify/functions/cache-stats`
**Shows:**
- Hit rate percentage
- Total entries/hits
- Cost savings estimate
- Recommendations

**Use:** Optimize cache performance, track savings

---

*Includes Supabase Pro upgrade ($25/mo) at 5k+ users

---

## Success Metrics

### Target KPIs
- ✅ Cache hit rate: > 60%
- ✅ Response time (cached): < 200ms
- ✅ Health status: "healthy"
- ✅ Cost per user: < $0.03
- ✅ Zero security incidents

### How to Track
1. **Cache hit rate:** Check cache-stats endpoint weekly
2. **Response times:** Monitor Netlify function logs
3. **Health:** Set up uptime monitoring on health endpoint
4. **Costs:** Review Google Cloud billing monthly
5. **Security:** Check rate_limits table for violations

---

## Rollback Plan

If anything goes wrong:

### Quick Rollback (5 min)
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### Full Rollback (15 min)
1. Go to Netlify → Deploys
2. Find previous working deploy
3. Click "Publish deploy"

### Database Rollback
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor (only if needed)
