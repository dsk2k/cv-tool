## Step 6: Test GA4 Tracking (5 minutes)

**Example console output:**

üìä Event tracked: language_selected {language: 'nl', language_name: 'Dutch'}
```

If you see these ‚Üí GA4 is working! ‚úÖ

## What If It's Not Working?

### ‚ùå "No users in Realtime"

- View page source: `Ctrl+U` and search for your real ID

### ‚ùå "Some events work, others don't"

**This is normal!**
- GA4 takes 24-48 hours to fully register new events
- As long as you see SOME events, it's working
- Check again tomorrow in standard reports

---

## What About Custom Domain Later?

### When You Add applyjobmatch.nl:

**Good News:** Nothing needs to change! üéâ

GA4 will automatically track both:
- `cvtool.netlify.app` (now)
- `applyjobmatch.nl` (later)

### Optional: Update Data Stream URL
1. Go to GA4 ‚Üí Admin ‚Üí Data Streams
2. Click on your stream
3. Change URL to `https://applyjobmatch.nl`
4. This is cosmetic only - tracking still works either way!

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. ‚úÖ Complete this GA4 setup
2. ‚úÖ Verify tracking works
3. ‚úÖ Familiarize yourself with Realtime reports

### Tomorrow:
1. Check standard reports (Admin ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí Engagement)
2. Events should appear in full reports (24 hour delay)
3. Start seeing user behavior patterns

### In 24 Hours (After Domain Wait):
1. Follow [SETUP_GUIDE.md](SETUP_GUIDE.md) Part 1 for custom domain
2. Point applyjobmatch.nl to Netlify
